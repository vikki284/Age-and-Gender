## Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to assign a label to an input image from a fixed set of categories. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of image classification due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images labeled into different categories. Each image is preprocessed and resized to a fixed dimension suitable for input into the CNN.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset was collected from reliable sources and preprocessed by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets.
   
2. **Model Development**:
   - A CNN was developed with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The model was trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized with an appropriate optimizer like Adam.

3. **Training and Validation**:
   - The model was trained on the training set with periodic validation to monitor performance and prevent overfitting. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enhance the generalization of the model.

## Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images using convolutional filters.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining important information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Act as the classifier that assigns labels to the images.
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final classification output.


## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for advanced image preprocessing)
  
## Results
The CNN achieved high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The model was able to generalize well, as evidenced by its performance on unseen data.
